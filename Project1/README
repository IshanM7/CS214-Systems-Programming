To test our program we first started with the given test case and manipulated that along with creating other test 
cases with edge cases that could have caused issues. some of these test cases were new lines and spaces before the first word,
words greater than width, words that are exactly the size of the width etc. We verified the output by comparing it to the expected outputs given 
and predicted different edge cases and how they should be displayed. along with simply counting the width to confirm that it all fit.
